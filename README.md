**All of the install scripts found in the internet for arch linux are super bloated, So  I decided to create my own, A minimal "lazy" script**

# Installation

**change the name of your storage device in basefull.sh and change to your username in base-chroot**

```
chmod +x basefull.sh && ./basefull.sh
(make the bash executable and run)
