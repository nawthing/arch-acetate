**All of the install scripts found in the internet for arch linux are super bloated, So I decided to create my own, A minimal "lazy" script**

# Installation

**Warning**

###### While partitioning with cfdisk, create two partitions only ie, EFI and ROOT. Or make your own tweaks before running it

```
chmod +x basebuild && ./basebuild
(make the bash executable and run)
